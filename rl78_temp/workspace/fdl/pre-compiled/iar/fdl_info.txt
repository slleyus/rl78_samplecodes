How to integrate:
=================

1) copy all the files into your project subdirectory

2) add all fdl*.* files into your project (workbench or make-file)

3) adapt project specific files as follows:

   a) fdl_descriptor.h:
      - adapt the pool configuration (please refer to the users manual for detailed description)

4) adapt the *.xcl file due to your requirements
   --> at least segments FAL_CODE and FAL_CNST should be defined

5) re-compile the project
