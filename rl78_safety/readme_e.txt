The Workspace folder includes all necessary files to build/debug the sample program on
CubeSuite+, an integrated development environment provided by Renesas Electronics Corporation. 
Double-click on the ".mtpj" file and CubeSuite+ will be booted, read the project information, 
and get ready for use.

Using the Workspace folder makes building and debugging possible without creating newly
a folder for CubeSuite+.
